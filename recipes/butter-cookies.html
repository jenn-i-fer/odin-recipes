    <p>describe recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>226g Butter</li>
        <li>140g Sugar, white</li>
        <li>4g Salt</li>
        <li>2 Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>15g Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>280g Flour, all-purpose</li>
        <li>up to 60g Milk</li>
        <li>3g Almond Extract, optional</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the paddle attachment on a stand mixer, cream together butter, sugar, and salt on mid-high until light
            and
            fluffy.</li>
        <li>Mix in egg yolks, vanilla extract, and (optional) almond extract until creamy.
        <li>Add flour and mix until crumbly. If dough is too crumbly add up to 60g milk (add as little as possible to
            minimize spreading during baking).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 portions. Flatten each into a 1" disk. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at
            least 30 minutes in the fridge (up to 3 days).</li>
        <li>Roll out your dough to about 1/4" and cut into your desired shapes (roll only a lightly floured surface or
            between sheets of parchment/plastic wrap).</li>
        <li>Bake 12 to 16 minutes (until cookies are golden brown on the bottom). Remove from oven and let cool for 5
            minutes on sheet pan then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
    </ol>
